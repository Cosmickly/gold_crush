# Gold Crush
Gold Crush is an isometric 4-player party game where you play as a cave explorer scrambling to collect as much gold as possible while the floor crumbles underneath you. Jump over pits, mine through rocks and ore, and grab as much gold as possible to win! Once you've fallen, you can throw bombs back on stage to take others down with you!

This was a university project to create a vertical slice for a game, and is thus closer to a prototype than a complete product. I've done my best to fix bugs and add QoL improvements, but will not likely continue with development.

# How To Play

Controllers are highly recommended! The south button is used for jumping, and the east button is used for the pickaxe and bombs. Keyboard controls are:
- Player 1: WASD to move, Z to jump, X for pickaxe and bombs
- Player 2: Arrows to move, > to jump, ? for pickaxe and bombs
- Player 3: TFGH to move, V to jump, B for pickaxe and bombs
- Player 2: IJKL to move, M to jump, < for pickaxe and bombs
